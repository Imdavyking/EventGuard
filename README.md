# ✈️ EventGuard – Autonomous Flight Delay Refunds Powered by Flight Status Data

> _"Travel protection that just works — automated, trustless, and on-chain."_

---

## 🧩 What is EventGuard?

**EventGuard** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Flare Network** that enables **on-chain refunds** for **flight delays or cancellations** — no paperwork, no waiting, and no airline customer support needed.

By leveraging real-time **Flight API data**, EventGuard allows users to **initiate smart contract-based claims** when a flight is officially reported as **delayed** or **cancelled**.

---

## 🌍 The Problem We Solve

Flight disruptions are a major pain point for travelers. Traditional compensation processes are:

- 🐌 **Slow** — Manual claims, long response times
- 🎲 **Inconsistent** — Varies between airlines and jurisdictions
- ❌ **Opaque** — Poor communication and limited transparency

---

## ✅ Our Solution

**EventGuard** offers a **frictionless, automated verification layer for flight protection**:

- ✈️ Flight status fetched in real-time via trusted APIs
- 🤖 Smart contracts verify disruption conditions on-chain
- 🔐 Trustless and tamper-proof logic
- 💸 Cryptocurrency refunds, processed on-demand

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **🎫 Buy Coverage**  
   Purchase a Flight Protection Ticket that is stored on-chain and linked to your wallet.

2. **📡 Monitor Status**  
   Our backend checks real-time flight data using a reliable **Flight Status API**.

3. **⚠️ Detect Trigger**  
   If your flight is marked `'Cancelled'` or `'Delayed'`, the system allows you to **initiate a claim**.

4. **💰 On-Demand Payout**  
   You trigger the refund via the smart contract UI, which checks the flight status again and sends stablecoin compensation (e.g., USDT) to your wallet if eligible.
