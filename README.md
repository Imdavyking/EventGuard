# ✈️ EventGuard – Flight Delay Refunds Powered by Decentralized Weather Data

> _"Automated travel protection using real-time weather data and smart contracts."_

---

## 🧩 Overview

**EventGuard** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Flare Network** that offers **automated refunds for flight delays or cancellations caused by adverse weather conditions**. It eliminates the need for travelers to file claims or deal with airline customer support.

Powered by **Flare’s Data Connector (FDC)**, EventGuard fetches **real-time weather data** from trusted APIs and triggers a **smart contract payout** if the conditions meet the defined threshold — such as heavy rain, storms, or poor visibility.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Problem

Flight delays and cancellations are a common headache for travelers, often due to uncontrollable weather factors. Traditional refund and compensation processes are:

- 🐌 Slow and paperwork-heavy
- ❌ Inconsistent across airlines
- 🤯 Frustrating and opaque for users

---

## ✅ Our Solution

EventGuard offers a **frictionless travel protection layer** that is:

- 🛰️ **Powered by real-time weather data**
- 🤖 **Automated with smart contracts**
- 🔐 **Trustless and transparent**
- 💸 **Instantly compensates users without disputes**

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Buy Coverage**  
   Users mint an NFT-based **Flight Protection Pass** when booking their flight.

2. **Weather Monitoring**  
   Flare’s **Data Connector (FDC)** fetches live weather data for the flight's departure airport.

3. **Trigger Detection**  
   If the weather data meets **predefined thresholds** (e.g. wind > 60km/h, rain > 15mm), a **refund is automatically processed**.

4. **Payout**  
   Users receive stablecoin compensation (e.g., USDT) directly to their wallet.
