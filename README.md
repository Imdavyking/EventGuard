# ✈️ EventGuard – Autonomous Flight Delay Refunds Powered by Flight Status Data

> _"Travel protection that just works — automated, trustless, and on-chain."_

---

## 🧩 What is EventGuard?

**EventGuard** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Flare Network** that provides **automated refunds** for **flight delays or cancellations** — no paperwork, no waiting, and no airline customer support needed.

By leveraging real-time **Flight API data**, EventGuard triggers **smart contract-based payouts** whenever your flight is officially reported as **delayed** or **cancelled**.

---

## 🌍 The Problem We Solve

Flight disruptions are a major pain point for travelers. Traditional compensation processes are:

- 🐌 **Slow** — Manual claims, long response times
- 🎲 **Inconsistent** — Varies between airlines and jurisdictions
- ❌ **Opaque** — Poor communication and limited transparency

---

## ✅ Our Solution

**EventGuard** offers a **frictionless, automated flight protection layer**:

- ✈️ Flight status fetched in real-time via trusted APIs
- 🤖 Smart contracts verify disruption conditions automatically
- 🔐 Trustless and tamper-proof logic
- 💸 Stablecoin refunds, instantly and transparently

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **🎫 Buy Coverage**  
   Purchase a Flight Protection Ticket that is stored directly on-chain and linked to your wallet.

2. **📡 Monitor Status**  
   Our backend checks real-time flight data using a reliable **Flight Status API**.

3. **⚠️ Detect Trigger**  
   If your flight is marked `'Cancelled'` or `'Delayed'`, the system triggers the refund logic on-chain.

4. **💰 Auto Payout**  
   Smart contract sends stablecoin compensation (e.g., USDT) directly to your wallet.
